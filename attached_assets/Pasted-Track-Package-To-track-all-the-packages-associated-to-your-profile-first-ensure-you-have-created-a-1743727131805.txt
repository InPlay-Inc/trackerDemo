Track Package
To track all the packages associated to your profile, first ensure you have created an account at https://track.shiprec.io/packages. This route is not authenticated, allowing package receivers to view the current location of their package.

Make a GET request to:

https://track.shiprec.io/api/packages/track?token=ADD_PACKAGE_TOKEN_ID_HERE

GET parameters:

Token (required): You can get the link to this package by clicking on the API button on the package UI.
interval_hours (optional): Granularity for older location reports. The backend will return the most recent location for each time interval of interval_hours hours, starting from the most recent location report (default 1, min 1, max 7 * 24)
Alternatively, see List and use the tokenId from the return body as a parameter.

Webhooks
Latest location report for token HTTPS requests will be sent whenever the backend receives a location update for a tracking token that is more recent than the last known location. The most recent known location is also sent immediately after a new token is generated for a device that already has a recent location report (i.e. <2 hours)

Two different webhook modes can be configured:

latest: Only receive one location report per webhook call with the latest report seen for this device (Will still be sent in a JSON array containing one element)
all: Receive all location reports for a device as they become available, including outdated ones that were reported with a delay
Webhook Target: This is a URL of a HTTP(S) service hosted by the client. Please send URL to hello@shiprec.io.
